### 🎨 Dashboard Creation

#### 🔎 Filters
- Filters were added to the charts to allow users to focus on specific regions, product categories, month and financial year.
- Clicking on a visual (e.g., a bar in the bar chart) acts as a filter, updating all other visuals.
- This ensures the dashboard tells a cohesive story and supports exploratory, interactive analysis.
- 
#### 🖼️ Design & Layout
- Colours were chosen for visual appeal and readability.
- Titles added to each chart for clarity and context.
- A clean, grid-based layout was used to allow for quick scanning and easy comparison of key metrics.

#### ⬇️ Drill-Downs
- The date hierarchy allows drill-down from Year → Quarter → Month.
- Drill-down works in combination with filters, enabling dynamic exploration of trends and detailed performance analysis.

    - The chart uses a dual-axis to show both metrics on the same view, allowing a comparison of total sales and profit.
  - **Sum of Sales by Group and Category**: a stacked column chart illustrating sales by Group, each stack represents a category.
  - **Sum of Quantity by Category**: total of items sold per category.
- **Interactivity:**
  - Filters that can be applied include category, month and group.
  - Slicers for year and region. <br> <br>
